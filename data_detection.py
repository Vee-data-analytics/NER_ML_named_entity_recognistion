Automated Data Extraction and Structuring

This script automates the process of extracting structured data from a text file and organizing it into a tabular format using spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) and pandas for data manipulation. Here's a documentation of what this script does:
Dependencies

    pandas for data manipulation.
    spacy for natural language processing and entity recognition.
    re for regular expressions.

Input Data

The script starts by reading a text file specified by file_path. It iterates through the lines in the file to extract and structure relevant information.
Named Entity Recognition (NER)

    It uses spaCy's English NER model (en_core_web_sm) to recognize entities in each line of text.
    Lines containing "Designator" are used as the starting point for reading data.
    Recognized entities in each line are stored in recognized_entities.

Data Structuring

    The recognized entities are organized into structured data.
    The script splits each line into parts based on multiple consecutive whitespace characters (e.g., tabs or spaces) using regular expressions.
    To ensure a consistent column count in the structured data, empty values are added if necessary.
    The structured data is stored as a list of lists.

DataFrame Creation

    A pandas DataFrame is created using the structured data, with columns named Col_0, Col_2, Col_4, Col_5, and Col_6.
    These columns correspond to "Designator," "Layer," "Center-X," "Center-Y," and "Rotation."
    Rows containing "Comment" in the "Designator" column are filtered out from the DataFrame.
    The resulting DataFrame is saved as an Excel file named "excel_pinck_.xlsx."

Output

The script prints the modified DataFrame, which contains the extracted and structured data, excluding rows with "Comment" in the "Designator" column.

This script is useful for automatically extracting structured data from text files, such as engineering or manufacturing reports, and converting it into a more accessible and analyzable format. It's a practical solution for tasks that involve processing unstructured text data into structured tables for further analysis.
